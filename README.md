## Problem Description
The task that we decided to focus on is the general workings of a gym franchise, MaxFitness. The model is centered on the Gym entity. This represents each physical gym location the company owns and operates. The gym includes different equipment, classes, and physical therapy sessions that it offers to its members. We want to accurately model these relationships and create data for the model, to populate the entities and attributes of our gym. Through the use of the data model, the gym can now be more efficient in creating new business plans to favor certain consumer trends, keeping track of members and membership types, and displaying relationships between different entities of the gym.
